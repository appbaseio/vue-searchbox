## 1. Intro

`Vue SearchBox` offers a lightweight (~22KB: Minified + Gzipped) and performance focused searchbox UI component to query and display results from your ElasticSearch app (aka index) using declarative props. It is an alternative to using the [DataSearch component](https://docs.appbase.io/docs/reactivesearch/vue/search/DataSearch/) from Vue ReactiveSearch.
